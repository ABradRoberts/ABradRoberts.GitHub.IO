The Phoenix Project is an excellent read which approaches the potentially boring topic of Agile and successfully turns it into an incredibly engaging tale. We follow Bill Palmer as he's given a project that is doomed to fail given the current cyber infrastructure and development operations tactics and we watch him turn his company into a well oiled machine.

Honestly... this book is kinda cheesy, I mean... It's like the worst situation and he just perfectly comes up with almost all the right answers just in time. Regardless, it's still a great book, the authors took about 50-100 pages worth of DevOps practices and transformed it into a 300 page novel. The crazy thing is that it actually works!

I loved this book, it really changed my perspective on development operations, infrastructure, and all the management that goes into it. It's actually almost poetic seeing what a perfect team looks like. Unfortunately, this is the real world, it doesn't quite work like that. Teams can propose all the right things but all it takes are a few individuals - like Sarah in the book - to ruin the groove.

This is one of my favorite "novels," I actually read it cover to cover in 8 days. I've never had a book that I ***truely*** couldn't put down. I would recommend this book to anyone new to Agile processes or anyone who says "Agile just gets in the way". I think this book does a pretty good job explaining the benefits of this methodology and why the failed alternatives sucks.
