No Starch Press is known for having "The finest in geek entertainment." Not going to lie, most of the time the books are so dry and technical that I just can't get through them. Not saying the information is bad, it's some of the best information in the world, it can just be dry. This book is 100% an exception.

I couldn't put this book down, I read this at the exact same time as The Phoenix Project and was just completely flooded with information. The Phoenix Project had the business side and How To Hack Like A GHOST had the technical side, but in a high-paced, engaging manner.

The book starts with solid infrastructure setup for penetration testing, and no, it's not "just another 'how to set up kali'", this actually walks through setting up reliable infrastructure as code in AWS. Using CloudFormation templates and Terraform to automate future infrastructure needs. I actually found an error in the Terraform setup and that made me feel like a million bucks but no-one responded to my email to the author. Regardless, this book also goes into strategies for being invisible when hacking (actually it was a bit extreme in my opinion unless you're doing some shady-shit, but a good chunk was a "must have" for any engagement."

The author does an incredible job with verbage and language throughout that kept me engaged and excited to find out what happened next. It was like reading a novel, but real world and very technical. More books need to be written in this manner.

This is without a doubt, my favorite technical hacking book. I'm going to fill my shelf with more works from the author (Sparc Flow) and I would encourage anyone getting into modern day penetration testing to do the same!
