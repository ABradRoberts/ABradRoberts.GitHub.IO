Hello, my name is Brad Roberts and I love offensive security operations. I'm currently holding the Offensive Security Certified Professional certification and am actively working towards my Offensive Security Web Expert. (stay tuned)

When I'm not trying to break things you can find me reading, hiking (just looking for snakes really...), playing with my beautiful dogs, or sitting around trying to get this website looking nice.

My hopes are to have sections for HackTheBox writeups, book reviews, and misc posts about whatever.
