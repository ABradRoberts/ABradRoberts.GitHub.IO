Am I crazy? I feel like people think I am, but am I really?? Do other people have this thought ringing around in their brain, bouncing back and forth like pong?

Why do I feel happiest when I'm loved? Not the "oh we're friends" but like "I like you" kind of love? I don't even know if it's true, so why do I obsess over it?????????? SOMEONE HELP ME!!

Love is the strongest motivator. Without it, I feel empty. I hate this, I feel like others STRIVE on being alone, they just kick ass and take names. But me, I just sit back and wonder if I'll ever get that again. That's so sad. God has a plan for my life and this is all very short sited, but every ping of pong makes me tick even more. Focused on the seconds, the clacking of the metronome. tick tick tick tick tick tick tick. Each tick in the past, as immutable as when X left. Equally as unimportant. The difference is how deep the neuroplastic tunnels are. Maybe I'll be healed someday completely. Will I be allowed to forget X? or are those tunnels to dug in? The metronomes ticks last but seconds, if that. New tunnel that collapses itself in a moment. The tick might as well have happened in the same moment i learned of the affair. But in this world what has greater depth? Who knows...

I find myself less and less looking forward to work being over as the days go by. I don't like being alone. I don't look forward to weekends. I turned off my phone this past weekend and 2 texts. 1 was my dad asking if I wanted a dog house, the other was Kyle asking where I went on friday. Bunch of nothing. I watched a few movies, slept too much. Mental relaps number 3. Luckily these are getting quicker and quicker to resolve themselves.

I need a hobby.

I want a girl who is gentle. someone who is sweet and soft spoken. someone mysterious. Adventurous, i wanna go on adventures around the world with her, climb mountains, swim in oceans, hike through fields, tread through streams. I want a girl who's a thinker, truly, can sit down and talk on a philosophical level without getting mad. A woman on fire for God, obviously. A woman who is beautiful! Ideally someone kinda techy who i can talk about work with. I would love it if she liked playing videogames! someone to do coop games with. what a dream. I want her to be fun and silly with me. Someone who i can feel completely open with, no judgement, just love and tenderness. I wanta girl with a short skirt, and a looooooooooooong jacket.

I pray i find her soon. And that she finds me! I want to be her hero, her knight in shining armor. I want her to feel safe with me, loved by me, liked by me, like i'm her one and only. I want that legendary level love. It takes work! it takes learning the love languages and TRULY WORKING for eachother. We'll have our ups and downs like everyone. But a love worthy of ballads is NOT out of reach. I'll find her I know it. If I don't, then i suppose what's the point? What is a man without a legacy and a life of love?
