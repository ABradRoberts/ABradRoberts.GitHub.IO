# HackTheBox Writeups

HackTheBox is one of the single greatest penetration test gaming sites there is! This platform has a wide array of challenges from capture-the-flag type anomalies in areas such as: Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Stegonography, OSINT, etc. to full blown virtual machines with a myriad of vulnerabilities.

This platform enables both offensive security and defensive security minded folks to come together and solve both modern and classic cyber challenges. For those looking to get their [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (like I was throughout 2020), this platform has EVERYTHING one needs to get one hell of a head start, in fact, it really has everything needed to be successful with the OSCP exam and others like it.

My passion is the offensive side, I love breaking things... Most of the time it's my head against a wall, but I'm always learning! That is the single most important skill to being a true cyber security professional: learning how to learn - and how to do it quickly and efficiently.

There will always be new vulnerabilities to learn, cutting-edge tools to master, and unique targets to break. Having a safe environment that is continuously updating with new content, allows script kiddies and professionals alike to test these tools and techniques in a safe environment, explicitly designed to be broken.

        What's a better time to start this blog than during the `Take It Easy Month` event?
